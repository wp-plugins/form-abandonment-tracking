Tracks form abandonment to the form field level as Google Analytics events, including Submits.

== Description ==

Tracks form abandonment to the form field level as Google Analytics events, including Submits. Each form will be tracked using it's ID, with each field using it's name, and each change of the field focus fires an event to Google Analytics tracking whether the field was empty (skipped) or not (completed). Submit is tracked as a separate event as well. In Google Analytics, these events will generate stats on number of fields completed, number skipped, and submits, with percentages, for each form on your web site.

The javascript is loaded into the footer of the site, and uses jQuery to detect the form field focus change, and requires that the Google Analytics code is already added to the site somehow.
